Problem:
========
- Buffering incomming data requires some memory to keep that data
- a big fixed size buffer might be to big for many cases, a buffer that's to small requires some kind of reallocating and copying  

Requirements:
============
- Fast allocating / deallocation
- fixed, continous blocks of memory to mark headers 
  - function, that returns a pointer if given a pair of begin/end iterators
  - this buffers could be used by json::objects and http::header
- returning as much memory as early as possible to be able to keep a lot of connections
