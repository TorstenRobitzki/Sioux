 Sioux is a framework to build Comet Web-Servers 
 ===============================================
 
It is based around a publish subscribe paradigm. A web client want to display a special set of data. If that data changes, the client want to get informed about that changes.

Currently only Bayeux with long-polling between server and client is implemented. On the client side, the JavaScript client library from the cometd project is used.

On the server side, a binding for C++ exists and a binding for Ruby/Rake.

 Dependencies
 ============

- Rake is used as build system 
- boost 
- cometd client library

 getting "started"
 =================

Currently this isn't an "out of the box" product. To get an overview, checkout the source and use "rake docu" to build oxygen documentation. "rake -T" gives an overview of the available build targets.

 Examples
 ========

Have a look at /source/tests/chat.cpp as a C++ chat example and /source/tests/ruby_chat.rb for the same in ruby.
